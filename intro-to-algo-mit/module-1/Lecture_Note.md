## Problem - Peak Finding
### Problem Statement
For a one dimentional array
```c
Arr = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i];
```
position 2 is peak if and only if b >= a and b >= c;

Given a 1d array, find a peak if it exists.

*NOTE: Using [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/) leetcode problem to validate my answer and that problem defines peak as
element which is strictly greater than its neighbors, it is a little different*
